# AdvancedSpyInventory
**A plugin to inspect ender chests and inventories of players and entities.**

This plugin allows to see the inventory of the players but also their ender chest, whether they are online or not. But although a lot of plugins already allow you to do, special features are present in addition to this plugin.

Indeed, the inventory and ender chest of the players is only the base, you could also see the inventory of the entities if they have one and see their equipment.
<br>For players as well as entities, you will be able to see and modify information like **health, food bar, number of experience and position**, for animals that are tamed, you will also know it.
